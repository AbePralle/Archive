PROJECT CLOSED - OCTOBER 7, 2012
===============================================================================
The programming language in this repository is called "Slag" but it is in fact
the final revision of the "Slag" language.  The original plan was to simply 
rename Slag as Slag but now Slag is a full, separate project in its own right.


The original README follows:

===============================================================================
OVERVIEW
===============================================================================
- Slag comes packaged with Plasmacore.  If you are primarily interested in 
  game development with Plasmacore you do not need to download Slag separately
  unless you are using Linux as your development platform.
  
- Slag 4.0 is currently under development.  The previous release (Slag 3.5)
  was under the language's old name and can be found elsewhere.
